# Hi there. Im Mark

## About Me
I'm a Software Developer and recent university graduate with strong interest in building practical real-world applications

I actively work on personal projects and continue developing my skills, explore new technologies, and strengthen my problem-solving abilities. 

I'm particularly interested in:

- Continuously improving my technical skill set by exploring new languages
- Applying best practices and development patterns wherever possible


Feel Free to explore my repositories and follow me as I grow as a developer
